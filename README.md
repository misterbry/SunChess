# SunChess

SunChess is a first-of-it's-kind chess platform that leverages the blockchain to provide a secure, incentive-based environment for students and chess enthusiasts. Defeating each bot will reward the user with SNAC, a Polygon-backed ERC-20 token, which can be redeemed for groceries at the local market.
